### Get App Bundle ID

Ref: [Finding the App Bundle ID | PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/guides/ios/current/faq/finding-the-app-bundle-id/)

1. With a store link, copy the app ID, and access the URL: `https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?id=ID`.
1. If everything has been typed correctly, the URL will return a `.txt` file.
1. Open the file, among the last lines (the 4th last for now) is a name `bundleID`.
1. The corresponding value is the bundle ID of this app.
