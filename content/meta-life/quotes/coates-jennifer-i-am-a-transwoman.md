_NOTE: Wow, I wrote this piece anonymously and privately and did not intend for anyone else to actually read it. It was a way for me to vent frustration without incurring risk. I didn’t tweet this out; I didn’t post or share this. Someone found it and spread it and that’s perfectly okay, but what you’re reading is essentially a diary entry._

**_If you are trans and closeted or suspect you might be, DO NOT treat my decisions as advice—they are based on my circumstances. Seek out and speak to other transwomen and absorb their experiences, too. Transitioning helps many, many people and living in hiding can be much more damaging. Let this be just one of many narratives you take in._**

**_如果你是一个还没有出柜的跨性别者或怀疑自己是，<u>不要</u>把我的决定当作建议——我做出的决定只基于我的个人情况。请找到其她的跨性别女性并同时听取她们的经验。性别过渡帮助了许多许多的人，而生活在柜子里可能比前者有害得多。把这篇文章当作你听过的许许多多故事中的一个吧。_**

I wake up from a dream that I am a girl, my heart racing, feeling sick to my stomach. I am not sick with disgust; I am sick with shame. It’s not the first time I’ve had this dream, although it is one of my earliest memories. What I feel (although I won’t have access to the metaphor until years later) is like I have, via a rogue HDMI adapter, accidentally projected my most intimate browsing history in front of a classroom. I feel that somehow I’ve been caught—as if everyone in the world watched my dream in their sleep last night. But I want to dream it again. I am six years old and I believe in God, so I pray to dream it again, which — of course — I do.
||
我从自己是个女孩的梦中醒来，心跳加速，胃部感到恶心。不是因为厌恶，而是因为羞愧。这不是我第一次做这个梦了，尽管它我最早的记忆之一。我感觉像是，通过一个失控的 HDMI 转换器，我不小心把自己最隐私的浏览记录投屏在全班面前（尽管我数年之后才能够通过这个比喻描述我的感受）。不知为何我有种被当场抓包的感觉——仿佛全世界昨晚睡觉时都在看我的梦。但我想再做一次这个梦。我当时六岁，信仰上帝，所以我祈祷能再梦到它一次——当然，我也确实梦到了。

In school we read a chapter book about a boy who changes into a girl. My heart throbs until I feel it in my teeth and I feel like everyone is staring at me. Of course, they aren’t. Back at home I stare at the cover, which shows a boy looking into a mirror to see a girl looking back, and I cry.

我们在学校读了一本关于一个男孩变成女孩的故事书。我的心快跳到嗓子眼了，感觉所有人都在盯着我。当然，他们并没有。回到家，我盯着书的封面，上面是一个男孩在照镜子，镜中一个女孩回望着，然后我哭了。

I hear from a terrible singing cricket that if you wish upon a star it will come true. Almost every night I sneak out of bed and stare out the window, wishing on every star I can see, just to cover my bases. Ever the magical thinker, I tell myself that if I wish out loud one thousand times, I will wake up with long hair in cute pajamas with a different name — and maybe freckles. One thousand, to me, is such a powerfully large number that the cosmic committees — which listen up at night for desperate, whispered wishes — couldn’t possibly miss me. _I wish I were a girl_, I say to myself over and over (demonstrating a frankly impressive grasp of the past subjunctive). Soon I am singing it to the tune of “The Farmer in the Dell.” I laugh at this, out loud, and it feels like there are two of me sitting awake in my bed — me in cuffed baseball pajamas, and me in the blue nightgown I covet on Wendy Darling.
||
我从一只唱歌的蟋蟀那听说，如果你对着某颗星星许愿，愿望就会成真。几乎每晚我都溜下床，盯着窗外，对着所有我能看到的星星许愿（以防万一）。因为曾相信“心想就会事成”，我告诉自己如果大声许愿一千次，醒来我将留着长发，穿着可爱的睡衣，有一个不同的名字，也许可能还有雀斑。一千次，对我来说是如此有力又巨大的数量，以至于宇宙委员会——一个每晚负责倾听急切、小声的许愿的协会不可能错过我。_我希望自己是个女孩_，我一次又一次对自己说，同时表现出我对虚拟语气的深刻理解。很快我把它用“山谷里的农夫”的调子唱了出来。我因此大声笑了起来，感觉有两个我醒着坐在床上——一个穿着袖口收紧的棒球睡衣，另一个穿着我渴望已久的温蒂・达林（译注：童话故事彼得潘里的角色）的蓝色睡裙。

My favorite people are (and will remain for my whole life) girls — my teachers, my mom’s friends, my classmates. I don’t like to play with boys. Boys are generally dumb and they have boogers in their noses. A somber ring finger performs a gender examination in my nostril. When I play computer games in private, I choose a female character. When it feels safe, I enter a female name. “Kimberly” is one I like, because Kimberly is the pink power ranger.
||
我最喜欢的人是（并且在我余生中仍会是）女孩们——我的老师，我妈妈的朋友，我的同学们。我不喜欢和男生玩。男孩们通常很蠢并且鼻子里都是鼻屎。一根忧郁的无名指在我的鼻孔中做着性别审查。当我私下里玩电脑游戏时，我会选择女性角色。当我觉得安全时，我会输入女性玩家名。“金伯莉”是我的爱用名之一，因为金伯莉是恐龙战队里的粉红战士。

I am jealous of my sister’s clothing. One day, home alone after school, I sneak into her room and pull on her Tinkerbell Halloween costume. I slip the elastic straps over my shoulders, then the tights along my legs. It fits. My heart feels like the fist of someone trapped under a frozen lake, battering the surface from underneath. How could anything feel so wonderful and so miserable at the same time? I don’t feel like a weight has been lifted — I feel like I’ve put down one weight and picked up another. I run to my room and hide the costume under my mattress. Later, I return it to my sister’s bedroom.
||
我嫉妒我姐妹的衣服。有一天放学后，我独自在家时溜进了她的房间，穿上了她的万圣节小叮当（译注：彼得潘里的小仙子角色）服装。我把翅膀的松紧背带套在我的双肩上，然后把紧身裤袜穿到腿上。很合身。我的心就像困在冰湖下，正从下面猛击着湖面的人的拳头。怎么会有这种让人感觉如此美妙，又如此痛苦的事？我并没有感觉如释重负——我感觉我卸下了一个担子，又扛起了另一个。我跑回自己的房间，把衣服藏在我的床垫下。之后，我把它放回了我姐妹的卧室。

I watch television every day after school. I am drawn to science fiction and supernatural fiction shows. In these shows are villains who can inhabit other bodies or shapeshift. There are machines that swap people’s brains. Even in the more realistic shows there are zany _Freaky Friday_ scenarios where Brother and Sister bonk heads and spend a day learning how hard the other’s life is. I have trouble understanding why Brother doesn’t drop to his knees and thank the god of head bonks.

我每天放学回家都看电视。那些科幻小说和超自然电视剧吸引了我。在这些剧里，反派可以占据别人的身体或者变形。有可以交换人们大脑的机器。甚至在更现实的节目里，也有像《辣妈辣妹》那种，姐弟撞到头后互换身体渡过了一天才了解彼此的生活有多艰难的滑稽情节。我很难理解为什么弟弟没有跪倒在地感谢上帝让他撞了头[^god-of-head-bonks]。

I am in a hotel room watching Maury Povich. A lineup of beautiful women makes its way onto the stage and we are told to guess which ones are “real” and which ones are “transsexual.” I don’t know about these words. I don’t even fully understand what “gay” is, although I pretend to. I suspect “transsexual” is related to “gay” but this doesn’t bother me. Instead, as the hotel coffee machine gurgles out an acrid belch, I feel hope welling up inside of me. How much does it cost to sit in the chair and have them flip the switch? Will it hurt? I don’t care. Any amount of pain will be worth it.

我在酒店房间里看《莫里秀》，一群漂亮的女人走上舞台，观众被要求猜测谁是“真的”，谁是“变性的”。我不知道这些词是什么意思。我甚至不能完全理解什么是“同性恋”，尽管我装作自己明白。我推测“变性者”和“同性恋”有关联，虽然这并未困扰我。相反，在酒店咖啡机发出尖锐的出气声时，我感到希望渐渐涌上心头。坐在椅子上让他们转换我的性别要花多少钱？会痛吗？我不在乎。再多的痛苦都是值得的。

I am watching a VHS tape in health class, put on by an unwitting substitute teacher who pulled one from the pile. It’s a human interest documentary from the nineties, recorded from television. It is about people they call transsexuals, and it espouses the easy-to-digest, binarist born-in-the-wrong-body narrative that will remain popular for another decade. The people in the documentary are not the beautiful, smiling, Hawaiian women on Maury Povich. They are tired. Old. Midwestern. The documentary explains about vaginoplasty. The reporter uses phrases like “the surgeon attempts” and “dilator” and “salvage.” Like “hormones” and “osteoporosis.” I fear needles; I fear pills; I fear scalpels; I fear hospitals. The reporter talks about a “long road to recovery.” I realize there is no chair and no switch. I realize also that I don’t fully understand pain. The tired, midwestern wives née husbands have grown their hair and wear dresses. They seem happy.

我在健康课上看录像带，是一个代课老师无意中从一堆录像带里抽出来放的。这是一部从电视上录下来的 90 年代人文纪录片。它讲述的是被称为“变性人”的人，并赞同一种易于理解的、“出生在错误的身体里”的性别二元主义叙事，这种叙事在之后的十年里一直很流行。纪录片中的人不像并不是莫里秀中那些美丽、微笑着的夏威夷女性。她们疲惫。衰老。来自美国中西部。纪录片讲解了阴道成型术。记者使用了“外科医生的尝试”、“扩张器”和“抢救”、“荷尔蒙”和“骨质疏松症”等短语。我害怕针头；我害怕药丸；我害怕手术刀；我害怕医院。记者还说到了“漫长的康复之路”。我意识到现实里没有椅子和转换按钮。我也意识到我还未完全理解痛苦是什么。屏幕中那些疲惫的中西部妻子（前-丈夫）们留着长发，穿着裙子。她们看起来很快乐。

The internet has arrived and I have learned with some relief that there is, at least for now, a condition called Gender Identity Disorder.

Some of these are my people. I meet boys who like to read what I like to read. I meet boys who also have terrible secrets. I meet boys who agree with me that it is terrible to be a boy, although they don’t seem to mean it in the same way that I do. We are not proud to be boys, but we have fun with each other. We throw rocks into ponds and have sixteen-year-old arguments about time travel. We steal condoms from the convenience store. We are beaten up sometimes. We watch Fight Club and beat each other up wearing layers of socks on our hands as boxing gloves. Then we give each other belly rubs—even the football players. We sneak into each other’s rooms late at night to tell stories. We download _Backyardigans_ episodes on LimeWire as a bit, but end up hosting weekly viewings out of sincere appreciation. We lie about our sexual experiences, but we listen raptly to each other’s lies as if they might contain traces of truth, like veins of sexy quartz. Some of the boys are straight and some of them are gay — I kiss a few of each. I realize that I do not love boys in the same way that I love girls, but I do love them still. I wonder what this means — if the fact that I prefer girls is evidence of my boyhood.

他们当中有些人是我的同类。我遇到和我阅读品味相同的男孩，我遇到一些同样有不可告人的秘密的男孩。我遇到一些也同意做男孩很糟糕的男孩，尽管他们似乎说这话的意思和我不同。我们不以身为男孩而自豪，但我们相处地很开心。我们往池塘里扔石头，用十六岁小孩的方式争论时间旅行。我们从便利店偷避孕套。我们有时会被殴打。我们看了《搏击俱乐部》，然后把好几层袜子套在手上，当作拳击手套用来互殴。然后我们互相揉肚子——甚至橄榄球运动员也会加入。我们在深夜偷偷溜进彼此的房间讲故事。我们在 LimeWire（译注：一款早期文件共享软件）下载了《花园小尖兵》当作乐子，但最终出于对它真诚的欣赏，我们开始每周都举行放映活动。我们在自己的性经历上撒谎，但我们全神贯注地倾听彼此的谎言，仿佛其中包含着真相的痕迹，像性感的石英脉络一样。有些男孩是异性恋，有些是同性恋——我每种都亲吻过。我意识到我爱男孩的方式和爱女孩的不同，但我仍然爱他们。我想知道这意味着什么——如果我更喜欢女孩的事实是我男孩身份的证据的话。

I start to consider what I might be, if my girlness hasn’t counted simply because it wasn’t overtly confessed. I think about my boyness—about my childhood and adolescence—how my experiences with boys deviated from what I was taught to expect. I change my major and spend a year writing about non-gay-identifying male femininity from the Aesthetics of the late 1880’s to vaudeville radio stars. Eventually, as a love/hate letter to coming-of-age films of the 80’s, 90’s and early 00’s, I write my thesis on the friendship and sexuality of American males and its representation in television & film. One piece of feedback is “I am so sick of boys writing about boys.”

我开始考虑我可能是什么样子，如果我的女孩特质仅仅因为没有被公开承认就不算数的话。我想到了我的男孩特质——我的童年和青春期——我与男孩们相处的经历如何与我被教导所预料的情况不同。我换了专业，花了一年时间写关于身份认同非同性恋的男性的女性气质，从 1880 年代后期的美学到杂耍广播明星。最终，作为对 80 年代、90 年代和 00 年代初青春电影的表白／仇恨信，我写了一篇关于美国男性的友谊和性行为及其在电视和电影中的表现的论文。有一条反馈是：“我实在受够了看男的写男的。”

I become an ardent fan of Eddie Izzard, who describes himself as a “male lesbian.” Though many accuse him of internalized transmisogyny — afraid to call himself trans — I at least admire his rejection of the constant attempts to squeeze his identity into a universal taxonomy that other people decided on.

I don’t think we are the same thing, but I think we have both come to the same conclusion.

Misandry humor is peaking and it is dripping with [cissexism](https://web.archive.org/web/20160330015135/http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Cissexism). Down cascade the gleeful tweets from ciswomen about how women are more beautiful than men — how graceful the female body is, how utilitarian the male. How awesome boobs are. How bad boys’ taste in clothing is. How incompetent they are emotionally. How they’re too weak to handle childbirth and periods. Neckbeards are the scourge of the internet. They wax disgusted about “dad bods.” SCUM rhetoric is revived with inconsistent levels of irony. The meme gospel says penises are just shitty clitorises.

On the internet where I used to Ask Jeeves “what is wrong with me,” I now get into a _lot_ of arguments about gender. I have always been revolted by my body hair but could never shave it. Even if I could raze my leg-brows without raising eyebrows, it comes back in with a distinctly male vigor. I mention to a cis feminist friend that I don’t think it’s cool to use “neckbeard” as a pejorative. I say I think it’s hypocritical. I say I know some wonderful, tender, thoughtful neckbearded humans. I also know some people who are very self-conscious about their neck hairs and can’t do much about them. I wonder if there are ways to criticize people based on their character without impugning the hairs that come out of them. She says I am mansplaining. She says I am Not-All-Men-ing. She also says I couldn’t possibly understand the standards of beauty imposed upon women. As if I didn’t spend years bent over a toilet, feeling miserably that even if I were thin enough I wouldn’t be girl enough.

And I hear my proudly misandrist-identifying cisfemale friends making fun of bald men as if it were a shortcoming or decision of the men themselves. Bald men make them think of television pedophiles.

A student in my performance art class hangs an empty mirror frame in the center of the room and has everyone pair off into subjects and reflections. A female classmate duplicates my actions perfectly with almost no delay. I look into the mirror and see her face and her freckles — I wave my hand and see painted nails. I get severely dizzy and have to leave the classroom. I cry big, shaking sobs in the men’s bathroom and come back twenty minutes later. The class is over.

在行为艺术课上，一个学生挂了一个空的镜框在房间中央，并让所有人两人一组配对成主体和镜中的倒影。一个女性同学几乎没有延迟地完美复制出了我的动作。我看向镜子，看到了她的脸和她的雀斑——我挥了挥我的手，然后看到了被涂了色的指甲。我感到一阵严重的眩晕，不得不离开教室。我在男厕所里大声哭泣，颤抖哽咽，二十分钟之后才回到教室。课已经结束了。

What I look like is this: a boy. A boy who has inherited a little more body hair than he can fight back, even in the places where he’s allowed to. A boy many ciswomen look at and say “you look like you like Mac DeMarco, ha ha.” (I do.) “I bet you read Jonathan Franzen.” (I don’t.) “I bet you like Breaking Bad.” (It was pretty good.) “I bet you are a self-proclaimed male feminist ally but don’t read women authors.” (Fuck right the fuck off.)

**Because there are social and financial repercussions to transitioning that I cannot afford emotionally or financially.** I don’t want to be treated like I have glass bones by well-intentioned cis friends. I don’t want to be told I am “so pretty” when I hate my reflection. It doesn’t make me feel better. It makes me feel worse, and it’s almost impossible to get cis people to turn it off. And I’m uncomfortable enough with the hateful judgment I get when I foray female-presenting into the city alone.
||
**因为进行性别过渡会带来社会和经济影响，而我在情感上或经济上都无法承受它们。** 我不想被一些善意的顺性别朋友当成脆弱的玻璃人对待。我不想在我讨厌自己镜子里的倒影的时候被别人告知我“很漂亮”。那不会让我感觉更好。那会让我感觉更糟，而且想让顺性别人不这样做几乎是不可能的。而且当我初次尝试以女性外表独自进入城市的时候，收到的仇视已经足够让我不舒服了。

There are monumental pros and cons to being trans-and-out and in some cases, like mine, the scales are locked even. I choose to experience my dysphoria in private and without relief to absorb the discomfort of delicate cis people so I can glide through the world more smoothly on a frothy trail of secrets and lies. (I’m being bratty and disingenuous here. I’m just afraid this is how you conceptualize it.) Gay and trans people have been doing this for centuries. It happens that I don’t quite think the climate is right for me to be Out ‘n About. But I am excited and happy for the trans children of tomorrow. Jealous of them, even. Maybe there will be a chair and a switch someday.

选择做出柜的跨性别者有很多好处和坏处，在一些特定情况下，以我自己为例，好处和坏处同样多。我选择私下里独自体验我的焦虑，不去承担脆弱顺人的不适，从而能在一条由秘密和谎言搭建的小径中顺畅地行走在世界上。（我在这表现得很讨厌且虚伪。我只是怕你们这样去概念化这个过程）男同性恋和跨性别群体这样做已经几个世纪了。碰巧，我也不觉得现在的环境适合我踏出柜门做任何事。但是我为跨性别儿童的未来感到高兴。甚至有些嫉妒 ta 们。也许未来 ta 们会有那个转换性别的椅子和按钮。

**Because it turns out transition isn’t the answer for everyone — to suggest otherwise is narrow-minded and proscriptive.** Because for some transwomen, femininity can feel asymptotic — the closer you get, the more you feel you can never make it. I realize it’s not an inspirational message but it’s a hard truth: _some people manage dysphoria better than others_. When you fight it, it fights back. I am a pharmacophobe and diagnosed obsessive compulsive. I can barely take NyQuil and a cowlick can make my blood pressure rise. I am not strong enough for that battle. I am not well equipped to transition.
||
**因为事实证明，性别过渡并不适合所有人——“它适合所有人”这种想法是狭隘且充满限制的。** 因为对于一些跨性别女性来说，女性气质就像是条渐近线——你越接近它，越觉得自己永远没办法成为它。我意识到这不是一个振奋人心的信息，而是一个残酷的事实：一些人可以比其他人更好的地掌控自己的焦虑情绪。你反抗它，它也会反抗你。我是一名药物恐惧症患者和经诊断的强迫症患者。我几乎没法吃 NyQuil（译注：美版白 + 黑感冒药），头上翘起来的头发都可能让我血压升高。我无法胜任这场战斗。我的条件不足以进行性别过渡。

**I have read the \#eggmode pieces.** [This one in particular is very good](https://archive.is/skxAY) and presents a valuable and kind-hearted perspective. I have seen transwomen use “egg” as a playful pejorative for a time in their lives when they were still developing their presentation and ideologies—sharing awkward pre-transition photos and shaming their past shelves for questionable aesthetic decisions. Even when it’s self-inflicted, it strikes me as deeply uncompassionate, but how these people deal with their own histories is their business. When it’s aimed at other people, though, in an effort to diminish their position or their authority on their own identity, it reflects a prescriptiveness and smugness that I would never have expected coming from the trans community.

**我读过那些打着 \#eggmode 标签的文章。** 尤其是这篇文章非常好，它提出了一个很有价值且善良好心的观点。我见过一些跨性别女性用“egg”作为一种戏谑的贬义词，来形容她们生命中还在发展自己的性别表达和意识形态的那段时期。她们分享性别过渡前那些尴尬的照片，并羞辱过去的自己那些糟糕的审美决策。即便她们只是在拿自己开玩笑，我仍觉得这种行为十分缺乏同情心——但如何评价和处理自己的过去是她们自己的事。然而，当被用来评价其 ta 人时，它试图削弱 ta 们对自己身份认同的权力，反映出了一种我从没想过会来自于跨性别社群内部的规训和傲慢。

Because **_it’s not a small deal_** that the words “not all men” have become entwined inextricably with male fragility and whininess. **It makes it awfully easy to insulate the (largely cis-)female perspective on what males are.** To begin a statement with those words—“Not All Men”—is to give grounds to anyone who wants to laugh at the rest of it. But here is the truth: not all men are what you think they are. _Man_ does not mean what you think it means. Generalizing harshly and broadly but implying “you know which ones I mean” is an intellectual and rhetorical laziness that is not allowed to pass anywhere else in these communities. Because we don’t get to choose who our words and behavior affect, we are obligated to choose them carefully.

**Because I have been reduced to my appearance — to the way I present for my own well-being — by cisfeminists so often that I feel a fucked up Stockholm syndrome attachment to being misgendered, and to this dual identity.** My dysmorphia is as entwined in my identity as anything else. I have lived with it for decades as a girl pretending to be a boy. And the nearer I get to something I’ve wanted my whole life, the more it feels like playing into the aesthetic politics of a group of people who reject me because of the associations they have with my body—a body which I cannot, ultimately, change very much.
