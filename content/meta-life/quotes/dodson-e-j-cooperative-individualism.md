## Begin quotation

· That, all persons share the same species-specific characteristics and have a similar need for the goods (e.g., adequate food, clothing, shelter, nurturing, medical care, education, leisure, culture and civic involvement) for a decent human existence.

· That, we join together in society to enhance our ability to acquire such goods and for our mutual benefit and enjoyment.

· That, the source of the material goods necessary for our survival is the earth, equal access to which is the birthright of all persons, as is the full enjoyment of what individuals produce therefrom.

· That, liberty is the basis for moral human behavior, inherent in which is the constraint that such behavior in no way infringes on the liberty of others.

· That, human behavior falls outside the realm of liberty and within the realm of criminal license when such behavior violates the liberty of others.

· That, the orderly functioning of society requires the granting to individuals of licenses that distribute privileges not enjoyed by others. To the extent such licenses come to have exchange value in the marketplace, this value is acknowledged to be societally-created. Justice requires, therefore, that society collect this value as a fund for equal distribution to all members of society and/or for societal expenditures democratically agreed upon; and

· That, a society is just the extent to which liberty is fully realized, equality of opportunity prevails, criminal license is appropriately penalized, the full exchange value of economic licenses is collected for distribution and/or societal use, and the wealth produced by one's individual labor (directly, or indirectly, with the assistance of capital goods) is protected as one's naturally rightful property and not subject to taxation or other forms of confiscation.
