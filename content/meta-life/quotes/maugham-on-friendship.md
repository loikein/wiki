There are two kinds of friendship. The first is a friendship of animal attraction; you like your friend not for any particular qualities or gifts, but simply because you are drawn to him. “_C’est mon ami parce que je l’aime; je l’aime parce que c’est mon ami._” It is unreasoning and unreasonable; and by the irony of things it is probable that you will have this feeling for someone quite unworthy of it. This kind of friendship, though sex has no active part in it, is really akin to love: it arises in the same way, and it is not improbable that it declines in the same way.

世上有两种友谊。一种友谊源于肉体本能的相吸，你喜欢的朋友不是因为他有什么特别的品质或禀赋，而仅仅是由于你被他所吸引。“C’est mon ami parce que je l’aime; je l’aime parce que c’est mon ami.（法语：这是我的朋友因为我爱他因为这是我的朋友。）”这是不讲理也无法讲理的。而世事多具讽刺意味，很可能你会对某人产生这样的感觉，可这人根本就不值得你喜欢。尽管这类友谊与性无关，但它的确与爱情相似：它以同样的方式产生，很可能也会以同样的方式消退。

The second kind of friendship is intellectual. You are attracted by the gifts of your new acquaintance. His ideas are unfamiliar; he has seen sides of life of which you are ignorant; his experience is impressive. But every well has a bottom and finally your friend will come to the end of what he has to tell you: this is the moment decisive for the continuation of your friendship. If he has nothing more in him than his experience and his reading have taught him, he can no longer interest or amuse you. The well is empty, and when you let the bucket down, nothing comes up. This explains why one so quickly makes warm friendships with new acquaintances and as quickly breaks them: also the dislike one feels for these persons afterwards, for the disappointment one experiences on discovering that one’s admiration was misplaced turns into contempt and aversion. Sometimes, for one reason or another, however, you continue to frequent these people. The way to profit by their society then is to make them yield you the advantages of new friends; by seeing them only at sufficiently long intervals to allow them to acquire fresh experiences and new thoughts. Gradually the disappointment you experienced at the discovery of their shallowness will wear off, habit brings with it an indulgence for their defects and you may keep up a pleasant friendship with them for many years. But if, having got to the end of your friend’s acquired knowledge, you find that he has something more, character, sensibility and a restless mind, then your friendship will grow stronger, and you will have a relationship as delightful in its way as the other friendship of physical attraction.

第二种友谊是知性的。吸引你的是新相识的才华禀赋。他有你不曾有过的观点想法，他见过生活中你未曾见过的东西，他的经历丰富，让人叹为观止。但是每一口井都有底，你朋友也会有一天不再有新东西传授给你：这便是决定你们的友谊能否继续的关键时刻。如果他只有些从书本和经历中得到的东西，他就没法再叫你感兴趣了。这口井已经空了，你把捅放下去，却什么也打不上来。这就是为什么人们会迅速发展起火热的友谊，又同样迅速地终结交往。这也揭示了为什么后来他会厌恶这些人，因为在发现这些人其实不值得自己欣赏倾配后，最初的失望会进而转变成鄙视和憎恨。不过有时，由于这样那样的原因，你依然与这些人保持不时的交往。如果是这样，想要从与他们的交往中获益，应该在两次会面之间留足时间，让他们来得及去获得新经验新思想，使他们又能像新交朋友一样给你以好处。慢慢地，当初发现他们浅薄时的失望渐渐消失，由于习惯了他们，你也就能容忍他们的缺点，于是你们便能长期保持关系融洽。但是，如果你发现朋友后天习得的知识虽到了头，他身上却还有其他的东西：个性、情感，还有活跃的思想，那么你们的友谊将益发牢固。这段友谊将令人无比愉悦，完全比得上肉体相吸产生的那种友谊。

It is conceivable that these two friendships should find their object in one and the same person; that would be the perfect friend. But to ask for that is to ask for the moon. On the other hand, when, as sometimes happens, there is an animal attraction on one side and an intellectual one on the other, only discord can ensue.

可以设想，这两种友谊的对象若是同一个人，那这个人就一定是最完美的朋友。但想要有这样的朋友无异于想上天揽月。另一方面，当一对朋友中一方是被肉体吸引，另一方则是被知性吸引，随之产生的只能是不和。

_When you are young friendship is very important, and every new friend you make is an exciting adventure. I do not remember who the persons were who occasioned these confused reflections, but since extreme youth is apt to make general rules from single instances, I surmise that I had found my feeling for someone to whom I was drawn unreciprocated, and that somebody else, whose mind had interested me, proved less intelligent than I had thought._

_年轻时，友谊非常重要，每交一个新朋友都是一次激动人心的冒险。我记不得是些什么人触发了我这一通稀里糊涂的想法，不过鉴于愣头青总是善于从个案中总结出普遍规律，我猜当时我是发现自己被谁吸引，但这情感却只是一头热，而另一个人的思想起初引起了我的注意，可最后我却发现自己高估了他的智力。_
