Excerpt from [BU-415: How to Charge and When to Charge? - Battery University](https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-415-how-to-charge-and-when-to-charge):

| **Frequently asked question**                              | **Lead acid<br>(Sealed, flooded)**                                              | **Nickel-based<br>(NiCd and NiMH)**                                                        | **Lithium-ion<br>(Li-ion, polymer)**                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **How should I prepare a new battery?**                    | Battery comes fully charged. Apply a topping[^topping] charge.                  | Charge 14–16h. Priming may be needed to format                                             | Apply a topping charge before use. No priming needed               |
| **Can I damage a battery with incorrect use?**             | Always store battery fully charged.                                             | Battery is robust. New pack will improve with use.                                         | Keep partially charged. Low charge can turn off protection circuit |
| **Do I need to apply a full charge?**                      | Fully charge every few weeks or months. Continuous low charge causes sulfation. | Partial charge is fine                                                                     | Partial charge better than a full charge                           |
| **Can I disrupt the charge cycle?**                        | Partial charge causes no harm when applying periodic fully saturated charges.   | Repeat charges can cause heat buildup                                                      | Partial charge causes no harm                                      |
| **Should I use up all battery energy before charging?**    | No, deep discharge wears battery down. Charge more often                        | Apply scheduled discharges only to prevent memory                                          | Deep discharge wears the battery down                              |
| **Do I have to worry about “memory”?**                     | No, there is no memory                                                          | Discharge NiCd every 1–3 months                                                            | No memory                                                          |
| **How do I calibrate a “smart” battery?**                  | Not applicable                                                                  | Apply discharge/charge when the fuel gauge gets inaccurate. Repeat every 1–3 months        | (Same as Nickel-based)                                             |
| **Can I charge with the device on?**                       | Avoid load if possible                                                          | Parasitic load can alter full-charge detection and overcharge battery or cause mini-cycles | (Same as Nickel-based)                                             |
| **Do I remove the battery when full?**                     | Charger switches to float charge                                                | Remove after a few days in charger                                                         | Not necessary; charger turns off                                   |
| **How do I store my battery?**                             | Keep cells above 2.10V; topping-charge[^topping] every 6 months.                | Store in cool place; can be stored fully discharged                                        | Store in cool place partially charged                              |
| **Does battery heat up on charge?**                        | Gets lukewarm towards end of charge                                             | Warm but must cool down when ready                                                         | Must stay cool or slightly warm                                    |
| **How do I charge when cold?**                             | Slow charge (0.1): 0–45°C (32–113°F) Fast charge (0.5–1C): 5–45°C (41–113°F)    | (Same as Lead acid)                                                                        | Do not charge below freezing                                       |
| **Can I charge at hot temperatures?**                      | Lower threshold by 3mV/°C above 25°C                                            | Battery will not fully charge when hot                                                     | Do not charge above 50°C (122°F)                                   |
| **What should I know about chargers?**                     | Charger should float at 2.25–2.30V/cell when ready                              | Battery should not get too hot and should include temp sensor                              | Battery must stay cool and no trickle charge when ready            |

[^topping]: Topping charge is applied on a battery that is in service or storage to maintain full charge and to prevent [sulfation](https://batteryuniversity.com/article/sulfation-and-how-to-prevent-it) on lead acid batteries.
