## Semantic HTML

### Readings

    > - Don’t use loads of `<h1>`s. Make `<h1>` the main heading of your page, then use `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, etc. in a proper hierarchy without skipping levels.
    > - `<section>` can be used with aria-label to signal to a screen reader user where a particular sub-part of an article begins and ends. Otherwise, forget about it, or use another element, such as `<aside aria-label=”quick summary”>` or `<div role=”region” aria-label=”quick summary”>`.
    > - `<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` and `<nav>` are very useful for screen reader users, and entirely transparent to those who don’t use assistive technology. So use them.
    > - `<article>` isn’t just for blog posts — it’s for any self-contained thing. It also helps WatchOS display your content properly.
